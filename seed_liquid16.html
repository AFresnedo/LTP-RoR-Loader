#PROBLEM TUPLE
Problem.create!(filename: "liquid16.html", text: "<p> A local business gets apple and grape juices in identical jugs and mixes just these juices to make a drink, which is then packaged in same-size bottles (but of different size than the jugs). One jug of apple juice used to be enough for exactly 6 bottles of the mix, and one jug of grape juice for exactly 10 bottles of mix. Then the recipe was changed, and one jug of apple juice is now sufficient for exactly 5 bottles of the mix. Home many bottles of mix is one jug of grape juice good for now? </p> ")
