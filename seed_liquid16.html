#PROBLEM TUPLE
Problem.create!(filename: "liquid16.html", text: "<p> A local business gets apple and grape juices in identical jugs and mixes just these juices to make a drink, which is then packaged in same-size bottles (but of different size than the jugs). One jug of apple juice used to be enough for exactly 6 bottles of the mix, and one jug of grape juice for exactly 10 bottles of mix. Then the recipe was changed, and one jug of apple juice is now sufficient for exactly 5 bottles of the mix. Home many bottles of mix is one jug of grape juice good for now? </p> ")
#SOLUTION TUPLE FOR PROBLEM P
S = P.Solution.create!(typ: "comparison", text: "<p> Because \(5\times 6=30\), and 30 can also be divided evenly by 10,  we use the amount of 30 bottles for comparing the old recipe to the new. With the old recipe, to make 30 bottles of mixed juice you need 5 jugs of apple juice and 3 jugs of grape juice. From here we find that 30 bottles of juice correspond to 8 jugs. </p>  <p> With the new recipe we use 6 jugs of apple juice instead of 5, so we have to add 2 more jugs of grape juice to arrive at the same quantity of 8 jugs. So 2 jugs of grape juice are enough for 30 bottles, which means that one jug is enough for \(\frac{30}{2}=\color{red}{15}\) bottles. </p> ")
