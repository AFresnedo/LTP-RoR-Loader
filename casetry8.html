<p>Going to school in the morning, Peter took with him 20 candies. On his way to
school he ate 3 times as many candies as he ate at school. Knowing that at school
Peter ate three times as many candies as he ate on his way back from school, fin
out  how many
candies did he still have when he arrived at home?

When Peter arrived at home, he still had [ ] candies.

<p>
The number of candies that Peter ate at school is 3 times
larger than the number of candies that he ate on his way
back home, and one third of the number of candies that he
ate on his way to school. Thus the number of candies that
Peter ate on his way to school is 9 times the number of
candies that he ate on his way from school.
So the number of candies that Peter ate on his way to school
can only be 9 or 18. 
</p>

<p>Case 1. If the number were 9, then he ate 3 candies at school,
and 1 one his way home, so he ate a total of \(9+3+1=13\) candies
being left with <font color="red">7</font> candies. 
</p>
<p>
Case 2. If the number were 18, then Peter ate 6 candies at school
and 2 candies on his way home, so he ate \(18+6+2=26\) candies.
This is impossible since he only had 20 candies. 
</p>

<p>
So the answer to the problem is <font color="red">7</font> candies.

The number of candies that Peter ate on his way
to school is nine times bigger than the number of candies
that Peter ate on his way back home.

:bhint:
What could be the number of candies that Peter ate on his
way to school? Notice that this number can be divided evenly
by 9.
